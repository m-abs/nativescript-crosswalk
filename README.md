# nativescript wrapper for Crosswalk

Based the original WebView by Telerik for NativeScript.

This is intended as a dropin replacement for the ui/web-view component
from NativeScript.
On Android it uses Crosswalk from (https://crosswalk-project.org/) inplace of
android.webkit.webview.
On iOS it uses WKWebView in stead of the old UIWebview.

iOS part hasn't been written yet, since I don't have access to an Mac at the moment.
